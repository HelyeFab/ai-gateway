# 🎯 Long-Term Vision: AI Gateway for Self-Hosted Services

## ✅ Purpose

To build a secure, scalable, and extensible **local API gateway** that:

* Lets **external apps** (e.g. Flutter, web clients, automation scripts) securely query AI services
* Protects access using **API keys, rate limits, and identity controls**
* Can **scale to multiple services** over time (e.g., chat, TTS, image gen)
* Is ready to move from **local dev to production deployment**

---

## 🔐 Security Philosophy

* **No exposed services without validation**
* Centralized **gatekeeper (Flask)** handles all key checking
* Caddy acts as a **secure ingress layer** with TLS support, reverse proxy, and route isolation

## 🧩 Modular Architecture Plan

| Component            | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Caddy**            | TLS termination, reverse proxy, route control                 |
| **Flask API**        | Authenticates requests, proxies to AI backends                |
| **API Key Store**    | Stores per-user/service keys securely with metadata           |
| **Services Layer**   | Ollama, Whisper, Edge-TTS, etc., running locally or in Docker |
| **Frontend Clients** | Local apps, mobile apps, scripts using the secured API        |

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* 🔐 OAuth2 or JWT support for user auth
* 📊 Per-user rate limiting and usage logging
* 🛠️ Admin dashboard for key generation and monitoring
* 🌍 Expose to WAN via domain (Cloudflare Tunnel, ZeroTier, or similar)
* 🚀 Deploy to a remote VPS with HTTPS, fail2ban, and firewall
